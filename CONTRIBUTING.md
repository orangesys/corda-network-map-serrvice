## Issue Management

### Labels
The issues backlog is actively managed. All issues are labeled for `importance` using [MSCW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) and `urgency` using [AQL method](https://www.drupal.org/core/issue-priority). Please use the MUST, SHOULD, COULD, WONT labels to define important and CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR for urgency on all issues raised using the [label defintions](https://gitlab.com/cordite/cordite/labels). 

### Milestones
The next two [milestones](https://gitlab.com/cordite/network-map-service/milestones) are open. Issues that are being actively worked on and expected to be delivered in time for the milestone are added to the milestone. Adding issues to milestones does not make them actively worked on. Only issues that are actively worked tend to make it into milestones!

### Tagging / Release
Please do not use tags. Tagging is reserved for releases.

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
We follow [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/5-min-overview/).  All successfull builds of master are released to [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cordite/) (as a snapshot), [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cordite/cordite/) (tagged EDGE) and the Cordite EDGE network is upgraded.

### Releases
Master is released every two weeks as a new tagged release to the public binary stores (maven central, dockerhub, gitlab artefacts) and the Cordite Test upgraded. Maintainers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) when tagging the code and creating new releases.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at community@cordite.foundation. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,

### CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENTS
The Apache Software Foundation desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to any Apache projects complete, sign, and submit via email an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) (ICLA)  
The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the ASF and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to any ASF project.  
For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on an Apache project, a [Corporate CLA](https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt) (CCLA) is available for contributing intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement.  
Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as an individual, which covers both contributions which are owned and those that are not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.  
The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so it must be signed by a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.  
The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work address.
