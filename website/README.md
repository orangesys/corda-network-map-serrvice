# Cordite Stats Site

This is a rough and ready example of the network map

## Issues

* Styling - some prettier colors
* Clusters and zoom, a click on the cluster should not zoom in too far
* Possible select box to choose your network
* Login page

## Building

This sub project must be rebuilt and `./public` must be checked-in.

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```
